Project where I connect a Sega Genesis controller to a Pi Pico

# Motivation
I'm a programmer and game developer, with a few titles released on the market. Retro games are my main inspiration, and I'm passionate about gamepads, keeping a diverse collection.</br>

I also enjoy working on small electronics projects. Recently, I started a new project, finally putting my plans into practice.</br>

# Description
I'm using an original Sega Genesis controller, connected to a DB9 female, which is connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico. With Python, I'm capturing the inputs from the gamepad.

# Connecting DB9 to the Pi Pico
Guide to connections on the board </br>
Separating the connections to make it easier to connect to the Pi Pico without a protoboard </br>

Pin 1 (Up) -> GPIO 2 </br>
Pin 2 (Down) -> GPIO 4 </br>
Pin 3 (Left) -> GPIO 6 </br>
Pin 4 (Right) -> GPIO 8 </br>
Pin 6 (Button B) -> GPIO 10 </br>
Pin 9 (Button A / Start) -> GPIO 12 </br>
Pins 7 and 8 (GND) -> GND of the Raspberry Pi Pico
